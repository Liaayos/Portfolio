        <h2>Call and Apply Methods</h2>
        <p>
            There is another way to set the value of this, we use the call() method.
            The first argument is always the value of this. If we need to place more arguments
            we need to do it after "this". If we didn't define this in the body of the funtion, we 
            still can call the "call()" placing as first parameter "null".
        </p>

        <h2>Memoization</h2>
        <p>
            It is the same as caching. When a function takes too long to return a value, we have the option
            to save the result in cache property; then we can take the value from that cache later.
        </p>

        <h2>Immediately Invoked Function Expressions</h2>
        <p>
            Also known as IFFE. This function is invoked once is created. This can be achieved by placing the 
            parenthesis after the function. Example (function (){}). If we place code inside and IFFE funtion,
            the variables will be available only when the function is called. This is useful when we are trying
            temporary variables. We also have the option to use safely strict mode using IFFE. If we place the 
            strict mode inside an IFFE function, it will only take that function as strict and we don't have to apply
            strict mode to the whole code.
        </p>

        <h2>Recursive Functions</h2>
        <p>
            This happens when a function is invoked by itself if a condition is met.
        </p>

        <h2>Callbacks</h2>
        <p>
            Callback are functions passed as arguments to other functions. Callback makes asynchronous programming easier.
            We need this when we are waiting for something to happen in the code, but we want the program to still run without
            waiting the event to happen.
        </p>

        <h2>Async Functions</h2>
        <p>
            Async functions allow to write code as if were synchronous. We can get to this point by using the await operator
            before the asynchronous function.
        </p>

        <h2>Generalized Functions</h2>
        <p>
            It is a good practice to use Callbacks to write generalized functions to keep the code reusable and clean.
        </p>

        <h2>Functions That Return Functions</h2>
        <p>
            Yes, we can return function from another function. To use the returned function of the function, we need
            to assign it to a variable.
        </p>

        <h2>Function Scope</h2>
        <p>
            Every function has its scope. When we define a function inside another funtion that function that is inside
            has access to the variables in the outter function. 
        </p>

        <h2>Functional Programming</h2>
        <p>
            It is programming paradigm. It uses pure functions mostly. Pure fuctions are the ones following
            these rules: The return value must come out of the provided arguments. Not changing values or data in the program.
            And if it is given the same values it will return the same result.
        </p>

        <h2>Higher-Order Functions</h2>
        <p>
            These functions are the ones that accept another function as an argument or return another function or both.

        </p>

        <h2>Currying</h2>
        <p>
            When a function is curried means that not all arguments have been provided. To make it work it returns a funtion with
            the arguments that were provided when first called and waits for the remaining arguments.
        </p>

        <h2>AJAX</h2>
        <p>
            Ajax is the way to get informacion a provide information to the server asynchronously. It also updates the web page without the 
            need to reloading.
        </p>

        <h2>The Fetch API</h2>
        <p>
            This is a living standar for requesting and sending data asynchronously. It only has one mandatory argument and it's the url.
            JSON is the most known format for AJAX. We can use the Request object to have more control over the request. Request is creating by 
            using the Request constructor. This constructor has the following properties: URL, method, headers, mode, cache, credentials and redirect.
        </p>

        <h2>Questions:</h2>
        <p>
            What is a blob object?
        </p>
