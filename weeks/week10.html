        <h2>Client-side form validation</h2>
        <p>
            Client-side validation is when we make sure that the information provided is in the correct format.
            It shouldn't be an estrict security validation but it should have the minimun requirements.
        </p>

        <h2>What is form validation?</h2>
        <p>
            This is when the browser validates the information entered and checks that is in the correct format. We
            can find "Please enter a valid email address" to ask you for specific format. When the information is correct, the browser
            will let you send the information.
        </p>

        <h2>Different types of client-side validation</h2>
        <p>
            There are two types of form validation, one is Built-in form validation, that uses HTML5 and it doesn't require much of 
            Javacript, but we cannot customize much of that. The other is with Javacript, it is way more customizable, however, we need to 
            create it from scratch.
        </p>

        <h2>Using built-in form validation</h2>
        <p>
            When we validate attributes on form elements. required: When something is mandadory. minlength, maxlenght, specifies the lenght of strings.
            min and max, specifies the lenght in numbers. type: It tells if the data is number or string or email or something else. pattern: says the pattern that
            the data needs to follow. An element is valid when an element matches :valid pseudo class, is not valid when the element matches invalid: css pseudo class.

        </p>

        <h2>Validating forms using JavaScript</h2>
        <p>
            This is used when we need to customize our forms. The Constraint Validation API is methods and properties in the form element DOM interface like.
            HTMLButtonElement, HTMLFieldSetElement, HTMLInputElement, HTMLOutputElement, HTMLSelectElement, HTMLTextAreaElement. The Constraint validation API makes some properties available on the 
            previous mentioned elements like validationMessage, validity, willValidate. Also makes available the following methods: checkValidity(), reportValidity(), setCustomValidity(message).
        </p>

        <h2>Using the Fetch API</h2>
        <p>
            This provides to Javacript the opportunity to access and control parts of the http pipeline. It has a global Fetch() to work asynchronously.
            The simple Fetch() takes one parameter and is the path to the source you want to fectch. This returns a promise that ends with a response object.
            That response is a representation of the HTTP and to get the JSON body we use json() method. Fetch has an optional second parameter, an init object
            that permits control over different strings. We can upload multiple files with HTML, input type="file" multiple. When there is rejection, it will bring a TypeError.
        </p>

        
        <h2>Questions:</h2>
        <p>
            What does an init object has inside?
            What are the cors and why sometimes we need to block them?
            What are headers?
