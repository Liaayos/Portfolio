        <h2>Notes:</h2>
        <p>What is the .value and innerHTML really doing in Javacript?

            What is inside the element is the Value.
            "When you want to get the user's input from any input or text area
            tabm you use the special word "value". When you want to show
            something to a user, you use a section and the special word 
            "innerHTML""
            
            JavaScript's local storage uses what techies call "key-value pairs"
            that's fancy talk for "description-stuff pairs", the key would
            be the name of the person and the value would be their address
            and phone number. title is the key and the audio file the value.
