        <h2>Forms</h2>
        <p>Forms are the one used to get information from the user.
            We create forms in HTML with "form". usually forms are sent to an URL, 
            but with Javacript we can get the information before is sent.
            Forms have attributes, types, actions...
            Using the DOM we can access the form elements with document.forms.nameOfTheForm.
            Forms have also properties, methods and events. One important method is the form.submit that sends
            the information to the URL. I can retrieve and change values in a form by using the 
            dot notation. For example: input.value = 'TheTextIWantToReplace';
            There are some form controls, to mention some of the common types would be:
            "input" "select" "textarea" "button" by default is always text, however, it can be changed.
            Form Validation: This is to check wether or not an user placed the right information.
            For example, the password has the minimun characteres. It is done in two ways, in the client-side using 
            JavaScript or server-side. Is recomended to use both. We can disable to submit button if the information
            provided is not correct in forms; we just need to add "disable".
        </p>

        <h2>Object-Oriented Programming</h2>
        <p>This is a way to call things of the real life, placed in programming.
            There are three important concepts in Object-Oriented Programming.
            Encapsulation:
            This is when the code to make it work is hidden.
            Polymorphism:
            This is when differente objects share the same method. (It can be override to adapt to any needs.)
            Inheritance:
            Is when we take the methods and properties of one object to another with the ability to add more.
            Classes:
            Are object's blueprint. We can create objects from classes and those objects will inherite what the class has.
            
        </p>

        <h2>Constructor Functions</h2>
        <p>This is the second way of creating objects. It uses This to represent the object that will be returned later.
            parentheses are not required unless there are any defaul arguments needed.
            This is the way to create it: constructedObject = new Object();. I like more literal way.
            
        </p>

        <h2>Class Declarations</h2>
        <p>It is very simple to create and very similar to other programming languages: 
            class NameOfTheClass {constructor({})}. Names must be capitalized.
        </p>

        <h2>Constructor Property</h2>
        <p>All objects have their own constructor. This can be used to copy the object without the need to 
            reference the actual constructor.
        </p>

        <h2>Static Methods</h2>
        <p>This is for using in Class Declarations. It is called by the class without using instances of the class.</p>

        <h2>Prototypal Inheritance</h2>
        <p>Every class has a prototype property, and it can be access by every instance of the class.</p>

        <h2>Prototype Property</h2>
        <p>This is useful when we don't have access to the class declaration, but we want to add
            properties and methods to the class. This is an example: ClassName.prototype.WhatWeWantToAccess = 'WithWhatWeWantToReplace';
        </p>

        <h2>Finding Out the Prototype</h2>
        <p>There are two ways of finding the prototype of the an object. We can use raph.constructor.prototype; or Object.getPrototypeOf(raph);
            We can also check if the it has its own property or it is inherited. with hasOwnProperty(). It is not posible to overwrite the prototype
            if class declarations are used.
        </p>

        <h2>Property Attributes and Descriptors</h2>
        <p>Each object's property has attibutes that provide information of the property. All these attributes
            are store in a property descriptor, this property descriptor is an object with values of each attribute.
            All these objects have these attibutes int he property descriptor: value, writable, enumerable, and configurable.
        </p>

        <h2>Getting and Setting Property Descriptors</h2>
        <p>We can use the Object.defineProperty() method to assign properties.
            Getters and Setters:
            An object property descriptor has get() or set() method, or both. 
        </p>

        <h2>Mixins</h2>
        <p>This is a way of adding properties and methods from some objects to others without the need to use Inheritance with mixin().
            It can be completed with Object.assign(), but this is the basic one. We can also add properties with Mixin.
            The good thing about this is that it can add lots of properties in one step.

        </p>

        <h2>Javacript</h2>
        <p>We have libraries in Javacript that makes taks easier to complete. As is being used for many programmers, it is common to find
            solutions in the web for problems. however, we should not rely completely in libraries because the bring more code to our own code.
            The most popular are jQuery, Lodash, React and Vue.js. There are tow useful manager packages that works to install other packages, called
            npm and Yarn. It is useful to have separated files, depending of the topic, when the code becomes larger. 
            There is also a way to compress the files on the server using gzip, that is a compression tool.
        </p>

        <h2>Minification</h2>
        <p>This is used to remove any non-necessary code and space to make the code run faster. This can make the code less readable; so, we must be careful.
            
        </p>

        

        <h2>Questions:</h2>
        <p>
            What is an instance of the class?
            What is the difference between an object and arrays?
            What is the difference between classes and Objects?
            I'm still confused with the use of "this".
