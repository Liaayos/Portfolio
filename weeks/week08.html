        <h1>Lia's Portfolio</h1>
       
        <h2>Transforms</h2>
        <p>
           This can be a property and funtion, it allows to translate, rotate scale and skew an element. 
            The value is more functions or just one. 
        </p>

        <h2>Translation</h2>
        <p>
           These functions allows to move elements in any direction using X and Y axes.
           Transforms are not supported in all browsers. They don't work on inline elements.
        </p>

        <h2>Scaling</h2>
        <p>
           This functions scales an element horizontally first and then vertically, scale(x,y).
           Scaling like translation has no impact on the flow of the document.
        </p>

        <h2>Rotation</h2>
        <p>
           As the name states, it rotates elements. It will rotate by the element's center with angles, declared as 
           degrees. 
        </p>

        <h2>Transitions</h2>
        <p>
           Transitions allows values of CSS properties to change with time. With transitions for example, colors 
           can be change gradually. To do this, we need to declare the original state of the element in the default
           style declaration, then declare the final state of the transitioned element and include transitions functions 
           in the default style declaration. The transition-duration Property sets the time that the element will take to
           transition.The transition-timing-function Property is more detailed, it allows to start fast and go slower or 
           start slow and become faster.
        </p>

        <h2>Transition-delay Property</h2>
        <p>
           It allows to delay the transition before it begins. A negative one will make it start immediately but it will begin 
           in some part of the way. This allows to play with these timings.
        </p>

        <h2>The transition Shorthand Property</h2>
        <p>
           There is a way to make shorter the code when writing transitions. This is achieve by placing everything in the same line.
           It starts with transition: transforms 0.3s ease-out 50ms. If delay is included, we must place the duration and before that, the delay.
        </p>

        <h2>Multiple Transitions</h2>
        <p>
           We can add multiple transitions at the same time. If we want the transitions to have different timings, we can separate by coma.
           It can be used Shorthand also to accomplish this.
        </p>

        <h2>Animations</h2>
        <p>
           Transitions animate elements but they are limited. Css animation allow to have full control over the animation.
           We need to use or define first and last keyframe to make animations. 
        </p>

        <h2>Keyframes</h2>
        <p>
           There are some steps to animate an element in CSS. First we need to create a named animation, attach that animation to an element in the element's property
           declaration block. It is important to not quote the animation name.
        </p>

        <h2>Animation Properties</h2>
        <p>
            animation-name, animation-duration (defines the length of time the animation will last), animation-timing-function (It defines how is going to progress in the duration of the animation),
            animation-iteration-count (It defines how many times the animation will play), animation-direction (To modify the default behavior of starting from 0% to 100% on the keyframe),
            animation-delay (Id defines how long will wait before starting the animation), animation-fill-mode (Defines what will happen before the animation iteration begins).

        </p>

        <h2>Canvas</h2>
        <p>
           Canas API allows us to create new things on the website without the need to download images from the network.
            We can also manipulate pixels, all using Javascript and Canvas. The Canvas coordinate System starts in the upper left hand in 0,0.
            When we find an anonymous function attached to an event listener, is because the function is bound to that event.

        </p>

        <h2>Drawing Shapes by Creating Paths</h2>
        <p>
           There are built-in methods to create rectangles and squares, however, there is no built-in methods for circles or triangles.
           We need to lay out the path of the shape. Paths create bluprints for the lines, we cannot see them until we provide them a stroke.
           With more complicated shapes, we need to layout the path, stroke it and fill it.

        </p>

        <h2>Radians</h2>
        <p>
           These are units to measure angles. One radiant is 180 degrees, two radiants is 360 degrees.
        </p>

        <h2>Drawing an Image to the Canvas</h2>
        <p>
           We can get an html element, but ensuring the element has loaded in the page with an event listener.
           Then set up the canvas context and making the area of the element visible.
        </p>

        <h2></h2>
        <p>
           We can also play with the pixels of an image and change them. Canvas allows us to grab the red, green 
           and blue values of each pixel and change them to another color. This is also posible with videos.
           We might find issues when trying to manipulate the videos and images, we can caths those errors with try and catch.

        </p>

        <h2>SVG</h2>
        <p>
            Scalable Vector Graphics, is a specific file format that permits to describe vector graphics, this is achieved by using XML (eXtensible Markup Language).
            A system to anotate plain text. Is better to use an image editor to create images, because creating them with SVG takes time and unnecessary effort.
            We can use RaphaÃ«l Library that makes animation easier when using SVG.
        </p>


        <h2>Questions:</h2>
        <p>
            Is Canvas and SVG Libraries? I don't quite understand what are they. Because they use Javascript but they have their own file names, as 
            we were using another programming language.
