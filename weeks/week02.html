        <h2>Notes:</h2>
        <h3>Comments</h3>
        <p> // With this, I will make a short comment,
            /* With this, I will make a longer comment*/
            I need to separate two statements by semicolon.
            There is no need for blocks to be terminated in semicolon.
        </p>
        <h3>RESERVED WORDS</h3>
        <p> These are the reserved words: abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch,
            char, class, const, continue, debugger, default,
            delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends,
            false, final, finally, float, for, function, goto,
            if, implements, import, in instanceof, int, interface,
            let, long, native, new, null, package, private, protected,
            public, return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized,
            this, throw, throws, transient, true, try, typeof, var, volatile,
            void, while, with, yield
        </p>
        <h3>DATA TYPES</h3>
        <p> • We can find String, Symbol, Number, Boolean, Undefined and Null.
            If a value is not of the primitive ones, it is an object, like arrays, functions and object literals.
        </p>

        <p>
            Typeof is a special operator that allows me to find the type of the value. 
        </p>

        <h3>VARIABLES</h3>
        <p> To declare and assign multiple vairables, I should separate them with comas.
            It is recommended to use only let and cons, but I can find var as well that works similar to let.
            LET allows me to change it, CONS will not.
            SCOPE
            When using CONST that means that I am using a block scope, so, I can use it only inside the scope I declared it.
            Scope refers wheter a constant or variable is accesible or not, there are two, global (it can be used everywhere) and local (only inside the scope)

        </p>

        <h3>STRINGS</h3>
        <p> I can access string methods using dot: name.lenght is the lenght of the variable that holds a name.
            I can use template literals like this `Hello!`; this will allow me to insert diferent expressions.
        </p>

        <h3>NUMBERS</h3>
        <p> Can be floating and integers. It has methods like toExponential()
        </p>

        <h3>METHODS</h3>
        <p> Methods are actions that objects can do. When calling a method, I should use dot operator, then the name of the method and finally parentheses.
            Methods ends with parentheses and properties don't
        </p>

        <h3>Undefined AND Null</h3>
        <p> Undefined if a variable has nothing in it.
            Null shows when it has no value.
        </p>

        <h3>ARRAYS</h3>
        <p> Is a ordered list that has values. It can have other arrays inside and it is an object.
            Pop, Push, Shift, and Unshift:
            Pop: will remove the last item of the array.
            Push: will appens a new item to the last espace of the array.
            Shift: will remove the first item.
            Unshift: will appens a new item to the first place.
            Concat: merges arrays.
            Join: Turns the array in string.
            Reverse: Reverses the order of the array.
            Sort: Sorts the array, alphabetically.
        </p>

        <h3>SETS</h3>
        <p> It contains unique values, it cannot have duplicates. Sets
            can be converted to arrays.
        </p>

        <h3>MAPS</h3>
        <p> Are similar to dictionaries, it has value key. It can be converted to arrays.
        </p>

        <h3>LOOPS</h3>
        <p> While, for, forEach, map, do... while (same as while only that is backwards)
        </p>

        <h3>FUNTIONS</h3>
        <p> Funtion declarations, funtion expressions (it's a funtion assign to a variable), 
            arrow funtions (the short ones).
            The parameters are the ones that we established when creating the funtion, the 
            arguments are those that we place once the funtion is called.
        </p>

        <h3>CALLBACKS</h3>
        <p>  Is a function that is passed as an argument to another funtion, this is known as a callback.
        </p>

        <h2>Questions:</h2>
        <p>
            There are somethings used in arrays that I think can work in sets as well, 
            is it different and we cannot mix things up? Or we can use some methods 
            from arrays to sets and vice versa.
            Is It map something similar to dictionaries? It seems it is…
        </p>
