        <h2>Notes:</h2>
        <h3>Object methods, "this"</h3>
        <p> Objects are created to represent the users and users or orders usually have actions, these are the funtion properties. They can be
            funtions or arrays. There are build-in objects and user-defined objects.
            If a property's values is a funtion, its name is method.
            Arrow Funtion have no THIS 
        </p>
        <h3>Object Literals</h3>
    
        <p> An object literal is a created object and wrapping all its properties and methods in curly braces. It is like 
            a dictionary for other programming languages.
            The properties in an object literal, are separated by comas, the keys are
            value pair, the first property can be a name, and the value of that 
            property could be "superman", as in the example in the book, the last one is a method and its value is a funtion.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are two ways of creating objects, here the examples:
            const hombrearaña = {};
            const hombrearaña = new Object();
        </p>

        <h3>Accessing Properties</h3>
        <p> It can be done by using the dot notation, examples:
            hombrearaña.name
            'hombrearaña'
            Also with bracket notation.
            hombrearaña['name']
            'hombrearaña'
        </p>

        <h3>Calling Methods</h3>
        <p> We can call an object's method with the dot and the bracket notation, as in the example above, it is the
            same as calling a funtion it has to have the parentheses. Example:
            hombrearaña.fly() //// hombrearaña['fly']()
            
        </p>

        <h3>Checking if Properties or Methods Exist</h3>
        <p> Using the in operator we can know if an object has a property.
            Example:
            'city' in hombrearaña;
            << false

            All objects have hasOwnProperty() and help us to check if the object has a property that belongs to it, or if another object is giving it. 
            For example:
            hombrearaña.hasOwnProperty('city');
            << false

            hombrearaña.hasOwnProperty('name');
            << true
        </p>

        <h3>Finding all the Properties of an Object</h3>
        <p> Here it uses the for in loop to go through all the properties in an
            object.
            
            
            for(const key in hombrearaña) {
            console.log(key + ": " + hombrearaña[key]);
        }
        << "name: hombrearaña"
        << "real name: Peter"
        << "height: 50"
        << "weight: 200"
        << "hero: true"
        << "villain: false"
        << "fly: function (){
            console.log(\"keep it up\");
        }"

        This example will make sure that iterates over an object's own properties,
        inherited ones will be ignored.
        for(const key in hombrearaña) {
            if(hombrearaña.hasOwnProperty(key)){
                console.log(key + ": " + hombrearaña[key]);
            }
        }

        The Object.keys() will return an array of all the keys. We also find Object.values()
        to get the object's value.
           
        </p>

        <h3>Adding Properties</h3>
        <p> This is an example in how can be done:
            hombrearaña.city = 'New York';
            << 'New York'
            Now it is created city property, and its value is New York and added to 
            the object hombrearaña.
        </p>

        <h3>Changing Properties</h3>
        <p> This is an example in how to change the value of an object's property:
            hombrearaña['real name'] = 'Peter Parker';
            << 'Peter Parker'
        </p>

        <h3>Removing Properties</h3>
        <p> It can be done by using delete operator, this is an example:
            delete hombrearaña.telaraña
            << true
        </p>

        <h3>Objects as Parameters to Functions</h3>
        <p> An object literal can be passed as a parameter to a funtion. For example using
            using a funtion called greet():

            function hello({greeting,name,age}) {
                return `${greeting}! My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;
            }

            How the code knows from where to take the greeting, name and age?
        </p>

        <h3>Built-in Objects</h3>
        <p> JSON:
            There are some differences with the other objects literals, its property names
            must be double-quoted, values are double-quoted strings, numbers, true, false,
            nulls, arrays and objects, it is not allow funtions as values.
            JSON has some methods:
            parse() method is used for taking a string data in JSON format and returning a 
            JavaScript object. For exaple:

            stringyfy() does the opposite, it takes a JavaScript object and returns a JASON data.
                       
        </p>

        <h3>Math Object</h3>
        <p> This is a built-in object it has properties representing mathematical constants,
            and methods as well. All properties in Math Object cannot be changed.
           
            It also has several methods. The Math.abs() will return the an integer of the number,
            for example if it is negative will return a positive number, if it is positive, it will return
            the same.

            The Math.ceil() rounds a number up to the next integer.
            Math.floor() rounds a number down to the next integer.
            Math.round() rounds a number to the nearest integer.
            Math.trunc() will return the integer part of a number. 4.9 will return 4.
            Math.exp() will raise a number to the power of Euler's constant. For example

            Math.random() will return a random number.
            There are also setter methods.
            There are more, if needed, check the book.
        </p>

        <h3>The RegExp Object</h3>
        <p>  There are two options to write regular expressions, showed in these examples:
            const pattern = /[a-zA-Z]+ing$/;
            const pattern = new RegExp('[a-zA-Z]+ing');
        </p>

        <h3>The Document Object Model</h3>
        <p>
            DOM allows access elements from a web page and also allows the interaction with the page;
            it represents an HTML document as network connected nodes.
            Nodes have a numerical code to know what type they are:
            1 = elemnent
            2 = attribute
            3 = text
            8 = comment
            9 = body

            Some methods from DOM level 0 that are still used:
            Document.body returns the body element of a web page.
            Document.images returns a node list of all the images in the document.
            Document.links returns a node list of all the a elements and area elements that have an href attribute.
            Document.anchors returns a node list of all the a elements that have a name attribute.
            Document.forms returns a node list of all the forms in the document.
   
        </p>
        <h3>Nodes</h3>
        <p>  childNodes property is a list of nodes that are children of one node. These methods are finding
            the nodes not the elements.
            To find the value we can use textContent, nodeValue property, innerText property works in a similar way.
        </p>

        <h3>Getting and Setting Attributes</h3>
        <p> 
            getAttribute() This is a method and it gives back the value of the attribute provided as an argument.
            setAttribute() This changes the value of an element's attributes. With two arguments: the attribute we
            want to change, and the value we want to set up.
            
        </p>

        <h3>Event Listeners</h3>
        <p>  The event listener lets me know when an evenet happens. Every time a page is 
            clicked a callback funtion will be called. Example below:
            document.body.addEventListener("click", doSomething);
            The event object is the type of the event, in the example above the type will say "click"
        </p>

        

        <h2>Questions:</h2>
        <p>     
            What are nodes?
            What is the difference between nodes and elements?
            How this i++ works when making for loops.
