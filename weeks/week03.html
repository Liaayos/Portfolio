        <h2>Notes:</h2>
        <h3>Object methods, "this"</h3>
        <p> Objects are created to represent the users and users or orders usually have actions, these are the funtion properties. They can be
            funtions or arrays. There are build-in objects and user-defined objects.
            If a property's values is a funtion, its name is method.
            Arrow Funtion have no THIS 
        </p>
        <h3>Object Literals</h3>
    
        <p> An object literal is a created object and wrapping all its properties and methods in curly braces. It is like 
            a dictionary.
            The properties in an object literal, are separated by comas, the keys are
            value pair, the first property can be a name, and the value of that 
            property could be "superman", as in the example in the book, the last one is a method and its value is a funtion.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are two ways of creating objects, here the examples:
            const hombrearaña = {};
            const hombrearaña = new Object();
        </p>

        <h3>Accessing Properties</h3>
        <p> It can be done by using the dot notation, examples:
            hombrearaña.name
            'hombrearaña'
            Also with bracket notation.
            hombrearaña['name']
            'hombrearaña'
        </p>

        <h3>Calling Methods</h3>
        <p> We can call an object's method with the dot and the bracket notation, as in the example above, it is the
            same as calling a funtion it has to have the parentheses. Example:
            hombrearaña.fly() //// hombrearaña['fly']()
            
        </p>

        <h3>Checking if Properties or Methods Exist</h3>
        <p> Using the in operator we can know if an object has a property.
            Example:
            'city' in hombrearaña;
            << false

            All objects have hasOwnProperty() and help us to check if the object has a property that belongs to it, or if another object is giving it. 
            For example:
            hombrearaña.hasOwnProperty('city');
            << false

            hombrearaña.hasOwnProperty('name');
            << true
        </p>

        <h3>Finding all the Properties of an Object</h3>
        <p> Here it uses the for in loop to go through all the properties in an
            object.
            
            
            for(const key in superman) {
            console.log(key + ": " + superman[key]);
        }
        << "name: hombrearaña"
        << "real name: Peter"
        << "height: 50"
        << "weight: 200"
        << "hero: true"
        << "villain: false"
        << "fly: function (){
            console.log(\"keep it up\");
        }"

        This example will make sure that iterates over an object's own properties,
        inherited ones will be ignored.
        for(const key in hombrearaña) {
            if(hombrearaña.hasOwnProperty(key)){
                console.log(key + ": " + hombrearaña[key]);
            }
        }

        The Object.keys() will return an array of all the keys. We also find Object.values()
        to get the object's value.
           
        </p>

        <h3>Adding Properties</h3>
        <p> This is an example in how can be done:
            superman.city = 'Metropolis';
            << 'Metropolis'
            Now it is created city property, and its value is metropolis and added to 
            the object superman.
        </p>

        <h3>Changing Properties</h3>
        <p> This is an example in how to change the value of an object's property:
            superman['real name'] = 'Kal-El';
            << 'Kal-El'
        </p>

        <h3>Removing Properties</h3>
        <p> It can be done by using delete operator, this is an example:
            delete superman.fly
            << true
        </p>

        <h3>Objects as Parameters to Functions</h3>
        <p> An object literal can be passed as a parameter to a funtion. For example using
            using a funtion called greet():

            function greet({greeting,name,age}) {
                return `${greeting}! My name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;
            }

            How the code knows from where to take the greeting, name and age?
        </p>

        <h3>Built-in Objects</h3>
        <p> JSON:
            There are some differences with the other objects literals, its property names
            must be double-quoted, values are double-quoted strings, numbers, true, false,
            nulls, arrays and objects, it is not allow funtions as values.
            JSON has some methods:
            parse() method is used for taking a string data in JSON format and returning a 
            JavaScript object. For exaple:

            JSON.parse(batman);
            << { name: 'Batman',
            'real name': 'Bruce Wayne',
            height: 74,
            weight: 210,
            hero: true,
            villain: false,
            allies: [ 'Robin', 'Batgirl', 'Superman' ] }

            stringyfy() does the opposite, it takes a JavaScript object and returns a JASON data.
            For example:

            const wonderWoman = {
                name: 'Wonder Woman',
                'real name': 'Diana Prince',
                height: 72,
                weight: 165,
                hero: true,
                villain: false,
                allies: ['Wonder Girl','Donna Troy','Superman'],
                lasso: function(){
                    console.log('You will tell the truth!');
                }
            }
            
            JSON.stringify(wonderWoman);
            << '{"name":"Wonder Woman","real name":"Diana Prince","height":72,
            "weight":165,"hero":true,"villain":false,"allies":["Wonder Girl",
            "Donna Troy","Superman"]}'
        </p>

        <h3>Math Object</h3>
        <p> This is a built-in object it has properties representing mathematical constants,
            and methods as well. All properties in Math Object cannot be changed, it has the follow 8 properties.
            Math.PI // The ratio of the circumference and diameter of a circle
            << 3.141592653589793

            Math.SQRT2 // The square root of 2
            << 1.4142135623730951

            Math.SQRT1_2 // The reciprocal of the square root of 2
            << 0.7071067811865476

            Math.E // Euler's constant
            << 2.718281828459045

            Math.LN2 // The natural logarithm of 2
            << 0.6931471805599453

            Math.LN10 // The natural logarithm of 10
            << 2.302585092994046

            Math.LOG2E // Log base 2 of Euler's constant
            << 1.4426950408889634

            Math.LOG10E // Log base 10 of Euler's constant
            << 0.4342944819032518


            It also has several methods. The Math.abs() will return the absolute value of a number,
            for example if it is negative will return a positive one, if it is positive, it will return
            the same.

            The Math.ceil() rounds a number up to the next integer.
            Math.floor() will round a number down to the next integer.
            Math.round() will round a number to the nearest integer.
            Math.trunc() will return the intger part of a number. 4.9 will return 4.
            Math.exp() will raise a number to the power of Euler's constant. For example:

            Math.exp(1); // This is Euler's constant
            << 2.718281828459045

            Math.exp(0); // Any number to the power of 0 is 1
            << 1

            Math.exp(-3);
            << 0.049787068367863944

            Math.pow() will raise any number that is the first argument given to the power
            of the second argument. Example: 
            Math.pow(3, 2); // 3 squared
            << 9

            Math.sqrt() will return the positive square root of a number.
            Math.cbrt() will return the cube root of numbers.
            Math.hypot() will return the square root of the sum of the squares of all its 
            arguments.
            Math.log()  will return natural logarithm of a number.
            Math.max() will return the maximum number of its arguments.
            Math.min() will return the minimum number of the given arguments.
            Math.sin() will return the sine of an angle.
            Math.cos() will return the cosine of an angle.
            Math.tan() will return the tangent of an angle.
            Math.asin() will return the arcsine of a number. The result is an angle.
            Math.acos() will return the arccosine of a number. The result is an angle.
            Math.atan() will return the arctangent of a number. The result is an angle.

            Math.random() will return a random number.
            There are also setter methods.
        </p>

        <h3>The RegExp Object</h3>
        <p>  There are two options to write regular expressions, showed in these examples:
            const pattern = /[a-zA-Z]+ing$/;
            const pattern = new RegExp('[a-zA-Z]+ing');
        </p>

        <h3>The Document Object Model</h3>
        <p>
            DOM allows access elememnts from a web page and also the interaction with the page
            it represents an HTML document as network connected nodes.
            Nodes have a numerical code to know what type they are:
            1 = elemnent
            2 = attribute
            3 = text
            8 = comment
            9 = body

            Some methods from DOM level 0 that are still used:
            Document.body returns the body element of a web page, as we saw in the previous example.
            Document.images returns a node list of all the images contained in the document.
            Document.links returns a node list of all the a> elements and area> elements that have an href attribute.
            Document.anchors returns a node list of all the a> elements that have a name attribute.
            Document.forms returns a node list of all the forms in the document. This will be used when we cover forms in Chapter 8.
   
        </p>
        <h3>Nodes</h3>
        <p>  childNodes property is a list of nodes that are children of one node. These methods are finding
            the nodes not the elements.
            To find the value we can use textContent, nodeValue property, innerText property works in a similar way.
        </p>

        <h3>Getting and Setting Attributes</h3>
        <p> 
            getAttribute() method returns the value of the attribute provided as an argument.
            setAttribute can change the value of an element's attributes. It takes two arguments: the attribute that you
            wish to change, and the new value of that attribute.
            className property allows us to change the class as showing in the example below:
            wonderWoman.className = 'hero'
            Result "hero"
            In this example we can create and add an element and text node.
            const flash = document.createElement('li');
            flash.textContent = 'Flash';
            innerHTML returns all the child elements of an element as a string, it can be used to change these children.
            For example:
            h1.innerHTML = 'Suicide Squad';  
            This changes the title to Suicide Squad.
        </p>

        <h3>Event Listeners</h3>
        <p>  The event listener lets me know when an evenet happens. Every time a page is 
            clicked a callback funtion will be called. Example below:
            document.body.addEventListener("click", doSomething);
            The event object is the type of the event, in the example above the type will say "click"
        </p>

        <h2>Questions:</h2>
        <p>     
            What are nodes?
            What is the difference between nodes and elements?
        </p>
