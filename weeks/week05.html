        <h2>Types Of Errors</h2>
        <p>System error: A problem with the System
            Programmer error: When the programmer makes the mistakes
            User error: When the user enters wrong data.
        </p>

        <h2>Exceptions</h2>
        <p>It is also a type of error. This error returns a message or value so we 
            have a clue in where to look for the error.
        </p>

        <h2>Stack Traces</h2>
        <p>When an exception happens, a stack trace is produced. This happens when we have
            several functions being called by other functions. We need to go up in the tree to
            look for the problem.
        </p>

        <h2>Warnings</h2>
        <p>The warnings appears when the error is not that bad. The program will not crash.</p>

        <h2>Strict Mode</h2>
        <p>This is an option to avoid big errors. It helps avoiding "poor style," this reduces
            the posibility to write bad code. We apply it by using "Use strict."
        </p>

        <h2>Linting Tools</h2>
        <p>These are tools to test Javacript's quality. It highlights "sloppy" programming. 
            It doesn't mean the code will be perfect but it will be more consistent.
        </p>

        <h2>Feature Detection</h2>
        <p>This is the recommended way to determine browser support. When using it, we apply an if 
            statement to check if the method exists.
        </p>

        <h2>The Trusty Alert</h2>
        <p>alert() is used for debugging, this stops the programn when reachs alert() until OK is clicked.

        </p>

        <h2>Debugging Tools</h2>
        <p> Browser allow us to debugg in the web, like Firefox, Edge, Chrome, Safari.</p>

        <h2>Error Objects</h2>
        <p>It can be created with a constructor function, and it helps to identify errors.
            ner Error(), EvalError, RangeError, ReferenceError, SyntaxError, TypeError, URIError, InternalError.
            We also create objects as constructors to create customized errors. They also have properties. Name, that
            returns the name of the error constructor funtion. message, that returns the description of the error. Stack, that
            provides the stack error.
        </p>

        <h2>Throwing Exceptions</h2>
        <p>The throw statement can used to make our own exceptions. The best practice is to used it with error. For example:
            throw new Error(). 
        </p>

        <h2>Exception Handling</h2>
        <p>A better way of handling errors is to catch them. We can deal with the errors or ignore them if we want to.
            We can use try, catch and finally to deal with errors. 
        </p>

        <h2>Tests</h2>
        <p>
            Tests are important in programming, our code will be more likely to work better and avoid future problems when we test it.
            There is a way of writing code called Test-driven Development. When we write tests, then code to pass that test, then we 
            make better the code (code refactor), and then refactor the code. This is called Test-driven Development.
        </p>

        <h2>Questions:</h2>
        <p>
            No questions for this week. :)
