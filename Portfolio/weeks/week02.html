        <h1>Lia's Portfolio</h1>

        <h2>Notes:</h2>
        <h3>Comments</h3>
        <p> // this is a short comment,
            /* This is a longer comment*/
            two statements can be separated by semicolon
            Blocks do not need to be terminated by a semicolon.
        </p>
        <h3>RESERVED WORDS</h3>
        <p> abstract, await, boolean, break, byte, case, catch,
            char, class, const, continue, debugger, default,
            delete, do, double, else, enum, export, extends,
            false, final, finally, float, for, function, goto,
            if, implements, import, in instanceof, int, interface,
            let, long, native, new, null, package, private, protected,
            public, return, short, static, super, switch, synchronized,
            this, throw, throws, transient, true, try, typeof, var, volatile,
            void, while, with, yield
        </p>
        <h3>DATA TYPES</h3>
        <p> • String
            • Symbol (The symbol primitive data type was only introduced in ES6.)
            • Number
            • Boolean
            • Undefined
            • Null
            Any value that is not one of the primitive data types listed above
            is an object. These include arrays, functions and object literals.
        </p>

        <p>
            JavaScript has a special operator called typeof for finding out the type of a value.
            typeof 'hello'<< 'string' typeof 10<< 'number' typeof true<< 'boolean' typeof { ninja: 'turtle' }<< 'object'
            typeof [ 1, 2, 3 ]<< 'object' (All non-primitive data types return a type of 'object' .) 
        </p>

        <h3>VARIABLES</h3>
        <p> You can declare and assign multiple variables at the
            same time if you separate them with commas. Recommended to use only let and cons.
            LET you can change it CONS you cannot
            SCOPE
            Using const and let to declare variables means they are block scoped, so their value only exists
            inside the block they are declared in.
            Scope is an important concept in programming. It refers to where a constant or variable is
            accessible by the program. There are two common scopes that are often referred to in programs:
            global scope and local scope.
        </p>

        <h3>STRINGS</h3>
        <p> I can access string methods using dot: name.lenght is the lenght of the variable that holds a name.
            I can use template literals like this `Hello!`; this will allow me to insert diferent expressions.
        </p>

        <h3>NUMBERS</h3>
        <p> Can be floating and integers. It has methods like toExponential()
        </p>

        <h3>METHODS</h3>
        <p> A method is an action that a primitive data type or object can perform. To call a method, 
            we use the dot operator (.) followed by the name of the method, followed by parentheses 
            (this is a useful way to distinguish between a property and a method ― methods end with 
            parentheses). For example, we can write a string in all capital letters using the toUpperCase() method:
        </p>

        <h3>Undefined AND Null</h3>
        <p> Undefined is the value given to a variable that has nothing inside.
            Null means it has not value.
        </p>

        <h3>ARRAYS</h3>
        <p> Ordered list of values. It can have other arrays inside and it is an object.
            Pop, Push, Shift, and Unshift:
            Pop: removes the last item of the array.
            Push: Appens new item to the last of the array.
            Shift: Removes the first item of the array.
            Unshift: Appens new item to the first place of the array.
            Concat: merges arrays.
            Join: Turns the array in string.
            Reverse: Reverses the order of the array.
            Sort: Sorts the array, alphabetically.
        </p>

        <h3>SETS</h3>
        <p> Collection of unique values, it cannot have duplicates. Sets
            can be converted to arrays.
        </p>

        <h3>MAPS</h3>
        <p> Are similar to dictionaries, it has value key. It can be converted to arrays.
        </p>

        <h3>LOOPS</h3>
        <p> While, for, forEach, map, do... while (same as while only that is backwards)
        </p>

        <h3>FUNTIONS</h3>
        <p> Funtion declarations, funtion expressions (it's a funtion assign to a variable), 
            arrow funtions (the short ones).
            The parameters are the ones that we stablished when creating the funtion, the 
            arguments are those that we place once the funtion is called.
        </p>

        <h3>CALLBACKS</h3>
        <p>  A function that is passed as an argument to another is known as a callback.
        </p>

        <h2>Questions:</h2>
        <p>
            There are somethings used in arrays that I think can work in sets as well, 
            is it different and we cannot mix things up? Or we can use some methods 
            from arrays to sets and vice versa.
            Is It map something similar to dictionaries? It seems it is…
